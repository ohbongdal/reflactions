What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

- people maybe exactly know when and where they should save a version but also they can forget,
 sometimes the point when automatic saving occurs is middle of working on some project so the saved version is meaningless,
 but it have a advantage of not forgetting.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

- writing a program entails writing several codes connected each other
 so when connecting with developing a program it is neccessary making a bundle of something connected,
 but documentary? maybe it needs too but it isn't always.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- .git directory is created and maybe other things are setted to make it work,
  because some setting is needed?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- a staging area is area for something will be committed at same time. it provides a tool for encapsulating relate files 
 working area includes files which in staging area and other things which maybe are include in other stating area.
 a repository include all commits
