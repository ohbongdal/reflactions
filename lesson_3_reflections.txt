When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when it is better or there isn't any other choice.
 that is, when i can't use my local computer or someone else takes a part in my project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- like making new branch it is possible for me to want try something out of master branch
 and if it is just not alone who work on the branch then what i didn't commit would be gone.
